# portfolio-winter-2020
Design Portfolio, Winter 2020, Created with ‚ù§Ô∏è and ü§ôüíØ by me, Sammy Robens-Paradise. This is my second seasonal portfolio, following my [`portfolio spring 2019`](https://github.com/SammyRobensParadise/portfolio-app). It is part of a continuous project to grow my skills as a web developer and designers, exploring different trends in each portfolio.
I hope you enjoy it!
